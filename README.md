# Filament String Art

## Disclamier

This is a work in progress and some things may be broken or the `README` does not completely match the actual project.

## What is this project?

This is a passion project of mine, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGccIFf6MF8).
The original idea is to recreate any image from a long (black) string, which is wrapped around nails in a round frame.
This WIP project provides an alorithm that takes any image and returns how a string must be wrapped around points on a frame to recreate the picture. Note that this is only a very loose adaptation of the algorithm presented in the linked video.

But now for the fun part. This project uses a 3D printer to first print the frame and then the actual strings that compose the picture.
This is achieved by producing custom GCode that streches filament across the frame to produce thin strings, similar to how the filament is extruded durings its production.
From some inital trails, this seems to work surprisingly well.

## Installation and Requirements

You need a recent python 3 installation (i developed and tested the project on python 3.11.x) and some basic libraries. Check out `requirements.txt`.

For a quick start:
```
git clone git@github.com:CapDaniels/filament_art.git
pip install -u requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Workflow

The GUI should walk you thorugh it. But the basic steps are:
 - Start by running the script
 - Select and configure your frame and your general settings.
 - You run the sting solver alorithm
 - You save the `.stl` model and the custom GCode. The scipt can now be closed.
 - You slice the model with the slicer of your choosing.
 - You manually need to copy the GCode generated by the python script and place it at the end of the of gcode that prints your frame (or run them after each other as separate files and be carefull with the axis homing. I can't tell you what to do <nobr>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. </nobr>)
 - You start the print and hope for the best.

Don't be scared if the first 2 or 3 stings fail. Some pressure needs to build up in the nozzle in order for a consistent stringing to work.

## Possible TODOs for future me or collaborators
 - refactor the GUI code of the solver
 - fine tune the line solver algorithm
 - maybe adapt a Radon transformation to find lines faster (this gives me headaches already since you need to solve an analytical form of the line model)
 - add support for other shapes
    - add support to avoid strings over concave areas
    - load paths from `svg` files or other formats
 - better GUI
 - add project saving in form of a `json` file
 - add functionality to do the merging of the GCode files in the GUI
 - (far future) package every release in an `exe` file, so that non python people have it easier
